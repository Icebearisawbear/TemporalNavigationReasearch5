  Key Characteristics of Timelines
    <hr>
</p>

  <h4 style="font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif;">
    <p>
      Chronological Order: Timelines organize events in the order in which they occurred, from past to present or future.
  </p>
    <p>
      Visual Representation: Timelines are often presented graphically, using lines, bars, or other visual elements to depict the passage of time and the sequence of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annotations: Timelines may include annotations, captions, or descriptions that provide additional context, explanations, or details about specific events.
</p>
    <p>
      Flexibility: Depending on the context, timelines can be highly structured and precise or more flexible and adaptable to changes in circumstances or new information.
</p>
    <p>
      In summary, timelines are versatile tools used in various fields and contexts to organize, visualize, and understand the sequence of events over time. Whether documenting historical developments, managing projects, reflecting on personal experiences, crafting fictional narratives, or advancing scientific knowledge, timelines play a crucial role in how we perceive and make sense of the passage of time.
